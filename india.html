			<h3 class="textIndia">Facts about sustainability in India</h3>
			<div class="sustainable-development-container">
			<ul class="IndiatextSummary2">
				<li> India ranks 109th globally in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Index, with an overall score of 63.99% that has been improving since 2020-21. Renewable energy leadership: India is a major player in the global renewable energy market, with a high ranking in wind and solar power, and it hosts international initiatives like the International Solar Alliance. Progress on SDG goals: India's SDG Index score has improved, and its "Spillover Score" of 95.74% indicates that its actions have a positive impact on other countries' ability to achieve their own goals.  Economic growth vs. environmental cost: While economic development has lifted many out of poverty, it has come with a significant environmental cost, with India having some of the most polluted cities in the world, according to the International Growth Centre (IGC).</li>
				<li> Lack of collaboration: Despite government initiatives and a growing awareness among consumers, there is a need for more widespread and collaborative efforts. Many initiatives operate in isolation, which limits their overall impact. Consumer behavior: There is evidence of growing consumer interest in sustainable practices. For example, two in every three consumers opt to trade in old devices when buying new ones, and one in four regularly participate in manufacturer-led electronic device recycling programs. Traditional roots: Sustainability is not a new concept for India, as many traditional practices have historically emphasized living in harmony with nature and being resourceful. Challenges and future outlook: While India has made progress, challenges remain in infrastructure development, widespread public awareness of major actions like using renewable energy, and ensuring inclusive and equitable distribution of benefits. The upcoming years are crucial for policymakers, businesses, and individuals to work together to address these issues.</li>

		<div class="SDGs-container">
		<img id="SDGs" src="sustainable_development_goals_India.jpg" alt="sustainable development goals">
		<ul class="IndiatextSummary3">
			<li> India is actively engaged with the UN's 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, aligning its national priorities with the goals of ending poverty and inequality, and fostering inclusive growth. National integration: India has incorporated the 17 SDGs into its national development agenda, emphasizing the principle of "no one left behind". Subnational monitoring: The SDG India Index, developed by NITI Aayog and the United Nations, measures and scores the performance of states and union territories on social, economic, and environmental progress, fostering competition and learning.Cooperative federalism: The country has adopted a cooperative federalism approach to achieve the SDGs, which involves cooperation between the central government, states, and local authorities. South-South cooperation: India also extends its commitment outward through capacity-building and knowledge-sharing with other developing nations. </li>
			<li> Poverty and hunger: Programs like the Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana provide credit to small businesses to create jobs and improve livelihoods, directly addressing Goal 1 - (No Poverty) and Goal 2 - (Zero Hunger). Economic growth and employment: The government has a "Make in India" initiative to boost manufacturing and a Start-up India program to encourage entrepreneurship, contributing to Goal 8 - (Decent Work and Economic Growth). Health and well-being: Initiatives focus on public health, including a high-speed internet network to improve access to services, supporting Goal 3 - (Good Health and Well-being). Climate action: India has set ambitious targets to reduce its carbon emissions, such as increasing non-fossil fuel-based energy capacity to 500 GW by 2030, aligning with Goal 13 - (Climate Action). Infrastructure: Investments are being made in resilient and sustainable infrastructure, such as the Bharat Broadband Network Ltd for rural connectivity.</li>
			<li> Global context: Despite India's efforts, the country has a large population and faces challenges in eradicating poverty, though it has made significant progress. Overall ranking: In the 2025 UN Sustainable Development Report, India ranked 99th out of 167 countries, indicating a need for continued and accelerated progress across all goals. Poverty reduction: Recent reports indicate positive trends in employment and a significant reduction in urban unemployment, alongside a rise in self-employment, particularly among women in rural areas.</li>
