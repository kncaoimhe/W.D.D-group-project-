		<h3 class="textIndia">Facts about India</h3>
		<p class="p1">• The population in India is 1.3 billion people. It is the seventh largest country in the world. The capital of India is New Delhi.</p>
		<p class="p1">• It is the world's second most populous country. The most populous and cosmopolitan cities in the world are Mumbai, Kolkata & Delhi. The world's fastest growing high technology centers are Bangalore, Chennai & Hyderabad.</p>
		<p class="p1">• India has 22 major languages and many more dialects. The official languages in India is English & Hindi.</p>
		<p class="p1">• The national animal is the tiger, the national bird is the peacock, and the national flower is the lotus.</p>
		<p class="p1">• The iconic Taj Mahal is one of the 7 Wonders of the World. It was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983.</p>
		<p class="p1">• The currency used in India is called Indian Rupees (INR).</p>

		<h3 class="textIndia">Facts about sustainability in India</h3>
		<p class="p1">• India ranks 109th globally in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Index, with an overall score of 63.99% that has been improving since 2020-21. Renewable energy leadership: India is a major player in the global renewable energy market, with a high ranking in wind and solar power, and it hosts international initiatives like the International Solar Alliance.</p>
		<p class="p1">• Progress on SDG goals: India's SDG Index score has improved, and its "Spillover Score" of 95.74% indicates that its actions have a positive impact on other countries' ability to achieve their own goals.  Economic growth vs. environmental cost: While economic development has lifted many out of poverty, it has come with a significant environmental cost, with India having some of the most polluted cities in the world, according to the International Growth Centre (IGC).</p>
		<p class="p1">• Lack of collaboration: Despite government initiatives and a growing awareness among consumers, there is a need for more widespread and collaborative efforts. Many initiatives operate in isolation, which limits their overall impact. Consumer behavior: There is evidence of growing consumer interest in sustainable practices. For example, two in every three consumers opt to trade in old devices when buying new ones, and one in four regularly participate in manufacturer-led electronic device recycling programs.</p>
		<p class="p1">• Traditional roots: Sustainability is not a new concept for India, as many traditional practices have historically emphasized living in harmony with nature and being resourceful. Challenges and future outlook: While India has made progress, challenges remain in infrastructure development, widespread public awareness of major actions like using renewable energy, and ensuring inclusive and equitable distribution of benefits. The upcoming years are crucial for policymakers, businesses, and individuals to work together to address these issues.</p>
