				<img class="ireland20thCenture" src="ireland1_S.png" alt="IRELAND 20th Century Poverty – FIGURE 1"/>
				<p>Before the 20th Century, Ireland (1845-1860) almost 6 million Irish people emigrated to United States of America (USA) and other part of the world, cause of the Great Famine, what representing almost 30% of population.
				</p>
				<p>According to the National Archives (2025), in 1911 Dublin “had the worst housing conditions of any city in the United Kingdom”. For example, at that time, in the Henriquetta Street (Dublin) had 15 houses fully of families with 835 people. It’s known that nearly 26,000 families lived in Dublin and almost 20 k of them lived in just one room. 
				</p>
				<p>During the First World War (WWI) (1914-1918) over 200k Irish men fought for Britain and 49k died. In the Second World War (WWII) (1942-1945) Ireland was neutral and about 50k Irish men and women volunteered (iwm.org.uk Why men of Ireland volunteered to fight in the WWI).

				<p>The Central Statistics Office was established in 1949 as the national statistical office of Ireland  but since 1911 the data was collected about poverty and other economic indicators named Census Reports.</p>
				<p>After the USA recession (2008), Ireland faces an increasingly consistency poverty rate (CSO, 2024), also a housing crisis affected the population and employment crisis in 2012. After that, the country reduced unemployment but have other issues involving homeless individuals, people with substance-use disorders, and refugees. In 2024, 11.7% of people were at poverty risk comparing to 10.6% in 2023. The Ireland Social Justice Department says that the country needs more efforts to support the population and decreases the poverty rates.</p><br>
