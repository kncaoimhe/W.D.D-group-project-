				<h3>The history of poverty in Ireland reflects major social and economic changes over several decades.</h3>
				<h5>1980s</h5>
				<p>In the 1980s, Ireland experienced high unemployment, low economic growth, and significant emigration. Many households struggled to meet basic needs, and poverty rates were high.</p>
				<h5>1990s to 2000s</h5>
				<p>During the 1990s and early 2000s, Ireland entered a period of rapid economic expansion known as the Celtic Tiger. This growth increased employment, raised incomes, and helped reduce poverty. Public investment also improved access to education, social services, and infrastructure. For many, living conditions improved significantly.</p>
				<h5>2008 crisis</h5>
				<p>However, the 2008 global financial crisis reversed much of this progress. Unemployment rose sharply, wages fell, and many families experienced greater financial pressure. Poverty rates increased, and groups already at risk became even more vulnerable.</p>
				<h5>2010 to 2020</h5>
				<p>In the following years, Ireland recovered economically, and employment levels rose again. Despite this recovery, poverty did not fall at the same pace. High rent costs, limited affordable housing, and increasing living expenses created new challenges for households with low incomes.</p>
				<h5>2020 to Nowadays</h5>
				<p>Today, Ireland continues to work on reducing poverty through social policies, welfare supports, and programmes aimed at improving access to housing, education, and employment. Although the country has made progress, reducing poverty remains a long-term issue that requires sustained action from the government and society.</p>
