				<p>Before the 20th Century, Ireland (1845-1860) almost 6 million Irish people emigrated to United States of America (USA) and other part of the world, cause of the Great Famine, what representing almost 30% of population.
				</p>
				<p>According to the National Archives (2025), in 1911 Dublin “had the worst housing conditions of any city in the United Kingdom”. For example, at that time, in the Henriquetta Street (Dublin) had 15 houses fully of families with 835 people. It’s known that nearly 26,000 families lived in Dublin and almost 20 k of them lived in just one room. 
				</p>
				<p>During the First World War (WWI) (1914-1918) over 200k Irish men fought for Britain and 49k died. In the Second World War (WWII) (1942-1945) Ireland was neutral and about 50k Irish men and women volunteered (iwm.org.uk Why men of Ireland volunteered to fight in the WWI).
