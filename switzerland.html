                        <!-- Paragraph explains poverty numbers and situations in 2018 -->
                        In 2018, Switzerland was still one of the richest countries in Europe. Even so, about 7.9% of the population (around 660,000 people) were income poor. Their earnings were too low to cover basic needs like food, housing, and daily expenses. Many had to make difficult choices every month because their money was not enough.
                        Many others were not officially poor but still faced financial pressure. For example, 1 in 8 people struggled to pay their bills, and around 20% could not afford an unexpected cost of CHF 2,500. This shows that a large part of the population lived very close to financial trouble.
                        Some people with jobs were still poor, which means that having work did not always protect them from money problems. High living costs and low wages made life hard for many workers. Families also often had to give up things like holidays or lived in homes with issues such as noise, dampness, or poor safety.
                        Even though long-term poverty is uncommon in Switzerland, these numbers show that many people still face real financial challenges. Poverty in a wealthy country may be hidden, but it affects daily life, opportunities, and well-being for many individuals and families.

                        In 2021, about 5.2% of people in Switzerland, or 448,000 people, could not afford important goods, services, or social activities because of money problems. Many could not pay for unexpected costs, replace old furniture, or go on a holiday. The poverty rate was 8.7%, which means these people earned less than the basic income needed for living. People most affected were unemployed, low-income workers, single parents, and some foreigners. Even some people with jobs struggled to make ends meet. Despite this, Switzerland still has one of the highest living standards in Europe.

                        <!-- Summary of 2023 income poverty data -->
                        In 2023, based on income from 2022, about 8.1% of the Swiss population lived below the poverty line. People most affected included those living alone, single parents with children, people without further education, and households where no one works. Even some people with jobs earned very little and struggled to cover their basic needs. Many households had difficulty paying bills, buying essential items, or participating in social activities due to money problems. Despite these challenges, Switzerland continues to be one of the richest countries in Europe, with a high overall standard of living, but these numbers show that financial difficulties still affect a significant part of the population.
